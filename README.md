## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WBK0/trycrypto-frontend/main/src/assets/trycrypto-macbook.png)

Trycrypto is an innovative educational application that allows users to learn trading on the cryptocurrency market. With Trycrypto, each user receives 10,000 virtual USDT to their account, enabling them to experiment with various investment strategies without risking their own funds. The project was built using React and styled components, ensuring smooth operation and an appealing appearance of the application.

What sets Trycrypto apart from other educational platforms is the ability to trade both on the spot market and futures. This allows users to understand the differences between these two types of trading and their impact on the cryptocurrency market.

The application utilizes the binance API, enabling it to fetch current prices from the cryptocurrency market. This ensures that Trycrypto provides users with access to the most up-to-date data, which is crucial in the world of finance.

Additionally, Trycrypto features a custom-built API in express.js and uses a PostgreSQL database. This not only ensures smooth operation of the application but also data security and reliability.
